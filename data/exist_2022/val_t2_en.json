The evidence that Freemasonry was introduced to North America by early Jewish immigrants from Holland who settled in Newport Rhode Island is provided by a notation written in their congregation's records which reads: On ye 5th day of ye 9th month 1658, ye 2nd Tisri A.A. 5518 Wee mett att ye House off Mordecai Campannall and after Synagog Wee gave Abm. Moses the degrees of Masonrie. In 1733, a Jew named Moses Nunis became the first person initiated into Freemasonry in Georgia at the age of 34 years. He died in 1787 and was buried with a Masonic funeral. It was into American Masonic lodges such as these that George Washington and many of the other founding fathers of the United States were inducted and initiated, as well as many of America's presidents since then. America's founding fathers conspired together in the Masonic lodges of colonial America with Jews, laying the groundwork for what would ultimately result in the thirteen colonies divorcing themselves from Great Britain. By doing so, they hoped to establish the United States as a New Jerusalem under the auspices of Freemasonry, Among Thomas Jefferson's friends was a Jewish merchant named David Isaacs, born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1760, immigrated to Richmond, Virginia, along with his brother, Isaiah Isaacs, where he became an active member of the Jewish community, a slave-trader, and business partner in the firm of Cohen & Isaacs. David Isaacs sold the ball of twine that was used by Thomas Jefferson's overseer to lay out the first of the University of Virginia's buildings, and encouraged Thomas Jefferson in learning about the Jewish faith. Correspondence from Isaacs to Jefferson shows him offering books and pamphlets on Jewish topics in addition to other books Jefferson had asked him to obtain. Isaacs sold Jefferson meat, butter, and cheese (the very last purchase of Jefferson's life was cheese from Isaacs), wax, fish, hops, and a bright bay horse named Tecumseh. David Isaacs lived in a long-term common-law marriage Nancy West, a free woman of color who had established a bakery next to David Isaacs shop. Their daughter, Julia Ann Isaacs, married Eston Hemmings, the son of Thomas Jefferson's slave, Sally Hemmings.",

As the song sing goes its good to be kind in all the right measures some of your measures arent quite right regarding Asian Nations, Sir; whether or not it's because your Father was partly gentically Jewish I know not but no outside reasons should interefere with your decisions regaring OUR Peoples or OUR Prosperity and Peace with the world.   We request that you drop a MOAB on that so called silk road Chinas using to colonize the world. We request U drop a MOAB on China everytime a shipment of fentanyl or its derivatives hits our mainland via Mexico Canada our shores from Sea to Shining Seas.   We request life imprisonment for drug dealers and their suppliers; noone has the authority to take a breath of life. We request inmates not beable to use weights etc only body weight and body mechanics to exercise and have one hour outdoor time and no common room areas; with all cooking cleaning etc to be done by citizens who've not broken the law; and who'll be paid a good wage and retirement. And that inmates NOT manufacture license plates or anyhting else, those jobs go to honest citizens. In mates may read etc but only for themselves and not for profit and not for gratuity for state or government piggy banks.   We request ALL pay taxes in order for YOU to get infrastructure and ALL our Great God Blessed USA needs done without being made to beg or bend to DNC RNC or ANYONE and when U decide youve done enough for the year return some tax cash to Bozo Bezos and crew gates buffett, etc; U do know U need to arrest Soros for outstanding warrants correct?; and if Bozo is culpable for trying to intimidate the Marine whom owns FedEx pls incarcerate BozoBezos and Crew, Thank You.   Theres more as Youre aware of which we'll talk of at our first debate. #bugshavedornotthatsthequestion #ouuu   And I request ALL attacks on myself and my kewl kat Sgt. Warhorse stop right now. I ran for president years ago with a different running Buddy and the Governor made sure I'd a permanently affixed humidifier; with the machine I turned in for repair, I could detach the humidifier. I affixed my mask, turned on the machine, turned on bluetooth on my cell and got a vapor shot of something which choked me and made me cough hard.   I was told I own the machine whichll have tested someday but in the mean time I ask my insurance to issue me a machine with no lil goodies attached or pls allow me to pickout my own machine and have mainecare cover it. Always be honest in ALL you accomplish pls and I very much look forward to our first live debate. Thank you Donald, Sir; Bruce.

        "text": "Chapter 1: Introduction (Part 1 of 2)… socialism, by no means an invention of nineteenth century Marxism but much older, must be conceptualized as an institutionalized interference with or aggression against private property and private property claims. Capitalism, on the other hand, is a social system based on the explicit recognition of private property and of nonaggressive, contractual exchanges between private property owners. Implied in this remark, as will become clear in the course of this treatise, is the belief that there must then exist varying types and degrees of socialism and capitalism, i.e., varying degrees to which private property rights are respected or ignored. Societies are not simply capitalist or socialist. Indeed, all existing societies are socialist to some extent. …… the overall degree of interference with property rights that exists in a given country, explains its overall wealth. The more socialist a country, the more hampered will be the process of production of new and the upkeep of old, existing wealth, and the poorer the country will remain or become. …… For one thing, in analyzing different types of socialism for which there exist real, historical examples (examples which, to be sure, very often are not called socialism, but are given a more appealing name), it is important to explain why, and in what way, every intervention anywhere, big or small, here or there, produces a particular disruptive effect on the social structure which a superficial, theoretically untrained observer, blinded by an immediate positive  consequence of a particular intervention, might not perceive. Yet this negative effect nonetheless exists, and with some delay will cause problems at a different place in the social fabric more numerous or severe than the ones originally solved by the initial act of intervening. Thus, for instance, highly visible positive effects of socialist policies such as cheap food prices, low rents, free this and free that, are not just positive things hanging in midair, unconnected to everything else, but rather are phenomena that have to be paid for somehow: by less and lower quality food, by housing shortages, decay and slums, by queuing up and corruption, and, further, by lower living standards, reduced capital-formation, and / or increased capital consumption. And a much less conspicuous but almost always positively mentioned fact — a greater feeling of solidarity among the people, the greater value attached to things like family, relatives, or friends, which is found to exist between, for instance, the East Germans as compared to their more individualistic, egoistic West / German counterparts — is again not a simple, isolated, unanalyzable fact. Such feelings are the result of a social system of constant shortages and of continually repressed opportunities to improve one’s situation by one’s own means. In East Germany, in order to accomplish the most simple routine tasks, such as a house repair which in other countries requires no more than a telephone call, you simply must rely more heavily on personal relations (as compared to impersonal business relations); and where someone’s public life is under constant observation by society, you simply have to go private. …",
