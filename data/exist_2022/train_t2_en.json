        "text": "Although the Christian denial isn't emphasized in the linked article, look at the following about the U.S., this is the reason for my incredulity of Christian worship of Jews. For 8 years, obama forbid Syrian Christian Refugees in the U.S., Jews are silent. Trump bans travel from certain terrorist nations, Jews around the world are rending clothing, saying banning muslim terrorists is the same as the U.S. turning away Jewish refugees prior to WWII. No Jewish protests against the ban on Christians. Folks, Jews hate Christians, or at minimum are extremely condescending towards them, they do not have Christian interests in mind. The inescapable conclusion is that Jews, of course not individually but collectively, intentionally or not, are destroying Christianity world wide, and if you push the point, every once in a while, a Jewish commenter lets leak out why they, indeed, hate Christians.  Jews are holding things they've never been subject to against modern Christians who never did it. Genealogy wise, Jews may not have a bloodline to Biblical Israel, and may never had ancestors victimized.  • Christians respect Jews.  • Jews disrespect and hate Christians. • Jews love muslims.  • Muslims hate Jews.  No room in America for Christian refugees  http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/228670-no-room-in-america-for-christian-refugees   ....The rapes of Christian women and the butchery of Christian children do not count. No matter how moved Americans were this Christmas season by the plight of their fellow Christ followers in Syria and Iraq, no matter how horrific the visuals of beheadings, enslavement, and mass murder...  The Christians are being raped, tortured, and murdered <u>by militias, not by the Syrian government. This technicality condemns them to continue to be victims without hope. And this technicality is being adhered to with all the tenacity with which President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s State Department manipulated quotas and created subterfuges to keep out the Jews fleeing the oppression of Nazi Germany. Obama no more wants the Middle East’s Christian refugees than Roosevelt wanted Europe’s Jewish refugees.  Report: ISIS Has Crucified, Tortured Thousands of Christians in Iraq, Syria  http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/29/report-isis-crucified-tortured-thousands-christians-iraq-syria/   barrack hussein obama, as president:  .....lashed out against the idea of giving preference to Christian refugees, describing it as shameful: That’s not American. That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion, obama had added.  But, he not only lashed out against the idea of giving Christians preference, he actually arranged; by playing word games; so that Christians refugees could not enter the U.S., see the link and excerpt at the beginning of this article.  Trump said, of the Christians:  Yes. Yes, they’ve been horribly treated. If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, or at least very, very tough, to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair — everybody was persecuted, in all fairness — but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.  But questions of equality aside, the idea of prioritizing Christian refugees over Muslims......is not only more humane; it brings benefits to America as well.",

        "text": "Why Girls Love the Badboy (Youtube Reply):There comes a point where what women want is not going to be what men want and that will finally start to have consequences. Our society has been obsessed with what gets modern women excited, but considering women have opted for progressiveness and independence, all these notions of me me me are going to appear more and more absurd and contradictory with time. You mention all the reasons she might like the badboy and most center around security in a world that's never been more secure in history. This shows just how inflexible their wish list is, and how unwilling they are to compromise for a partner even if those compromises offer something sustainable long term. I completely understand where you're coming from and it's not women's fault for their genetic desires. But what will come at a cost to them is their blatant ignorance on what men want. Most men court women rather than passively waiting for them to approach because they're raised to believe she is better than all this. We're raised to see her as someone that values organic companionship, trust, loyalty and compatibility. Women however continue to preserve their own fantasy while completely destroying the fantasy of men. And while most men have abandoned their fantasy; showing a willingness in hard times to even dig through the junkyard scraps of single moms, sluts, feminists, and emotionally absent relics of femininity... This will eventually come to an end if women do not decide to meet us in the middle somewhere. Why? Social media has expedited the redpill in a way that even young men are being exposed to truths they shouldn't be facing till their 30's. Women in the past got they wanted by preserving some of (our) fantasy. Instead, we get Tinder results and porn, while they get their bad boys and the baggage he leaves them with.",

Bitch, you're not the victim here. You either a) put a baby in someone who you knew or should have known would kill said baby or b) you gave babies to people with reckless disregard to whether they would kill them. It is not uncommon for this demographic to kill babies so you had a duty to vet them for their murderous tendencies. This is no different than if you hire a baby sitter who either a) you know kills children or 2) was a member of a group who had a 23% (https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abortion-common-experience-us-women-despite-dramatic-declines-rates) rate of killing children and you didn't bother to ask or run a background check. If you did this you would rightfully (inb4 court shouldn't exist) be charged with negligent homicide.4) Aside from the fact that this is Alabama, I don't know how you got standing. Legally, you're just some guy. Because that's what you CHOOSE to be. You can't DNA test someone at the embryonic stage so there is no way for you to establish you status as anything other than some guy. MORALLY, you're just some guy. If I was arbitrator of AnCapistan I'd tell you to go fuck yourself and get out of my office. Even if you could establish paternity that's what I would tell you (though I have a let the chips fall where they may perspective on non established parties in abortion cases so if you dealt with it yourself I'd tell their heirs to gtfo too, and I acknowledge that that's not really an option you have under statism. But I don't gaf because you had SO many other options here.)5) This fence sitting that men do is getting retarded. (Yes, women allow it; I bitch at them enough.) You either want the title or you don't. If you want the title, then get up off your ass, get a fucking job, commit, and head the family. If you don't want the title, fine, then do what you're gonna do, but when shit doesn't go your way you have no rights because you have no responsibilities. You're not head of the family on days you feel like it. You either are or you aren't. If you choose that you aren't then you're just some guy when decisions have to be made, including non-murder-y decisions of course, because women can't rely on you so they are going to rely on themselves.6) No, I do not care more about the fact that this will create disincentives for clinics to commit feticide. Feticide (as a form of birth control anyway) is a symptom of people arranging their lives in new and interestingly stupid ways, not the other way around. If he was married to her I'd have *SOME* sympathy, but still tell him that he needed to vet better.",
